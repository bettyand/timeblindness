                <h1>What is Time Blindness?</h1>
                <div class="about">
                    <p>Time blindness, or time agnosia, is the impaired ability to perceive the passage of time.</p>

                    <p>This is a common experience for ADHD, autistic, and other neurodivergent individuals. In fact,
                        that
                        applies to both of this app's developers! Other leading causes of time agnosia include strokes
                        and
                        head injuries.</p>

                    <p>Time can seem to stretch on for ages or pass in the blink of an eye, regardless of the actual
                        duration. This can cause difficulties with planning, being on time, maintaining a routine, and
                        more.
                    </p>

                    <p>This app aims to help! By collecting data on how long it takes to perform common tasks, users can
                        improve their scheduling and time management skills. With practice, users may even improve their
                        ability to estimate how much time new tasks will take.</p>

                    <p>We have many more features in mind for future versions, and would love to get feedback and
                        suggestions from the community.</p>
